# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1\. Overview

**App Name:** Flyx

Flyx is a comprehensive Progressive Web App (PWA) that transforms university campus engagement by combining event discovery, social interaction, and community building into one seamless platform. Designed specifically for a 15,000+ student campus environment, Flyx serves as the central hub where students discover and register for events, join clubs, share real-time experiences, and build their campus legacy through an intuitive, Instagram-meets-BookMyShow interface.

The app targets three primary user groups: students seeking engaging campus experiences, club administrators managing events and memberships, and event organizers coordinating large-scale campus activities. Flyx solves the critical problem of fragmented campus communication and engagement by replacing scattered WhatsApp groups, email chains, and physical bulletin boards with a unified, personalized, and intelligent platform that ensures no student misses opportunities that matter to them.
